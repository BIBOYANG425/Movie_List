MARQUEE APP - ONE-PAGE SUMMARY

WHAT IT IS
Marquee is a web app for ranking movies in S/A/B/C/D tiers.
It also keeps a personal watch-later list.
The root app uses Supabase for auth/data and TMDB for search.

WHO IT'S FOR
Primary user/persona: Movie fans building a personal canon.
Formal persona documentation: Not found in repo.

WHAT IT DOES
- Email/password sign-up and sign-in.
- Protected routes for landing, auth, and app views.
- Tier board with drag-and-drop moves.
- Add movies via TMDB search and suggestion sets.
- Compare placement step before final rank insert.
- Watch Later list with save, remove, and promote actions.
- Stats charts for tier mix and media split.

HOW IT WORKS (REPO EVIDENCE)
- UI layer: React + Vite single-page app.
- Routing in App.tsx; auth state in AuthContext.tsx.
- Supabase client is created in lib/supabase.ts.
- RankingAppPage.tsx reads/writes user_rankings and
  watchlist_items using user-scoped queries.
- AddMediaModal.tsx calls services/tmdbService.ts in browser.
- supabase_schema.sql defines profiles, rankings,
  watchlist tables, RLS policies, and signup trigger.
- server.js serves built dist assets with Express.
- A separate FastAPI backend exists under backend/.
- backend/app/api/media.py and social.py include TODO/501 stubs.
- Root frontend calls to that FastAPI API:
